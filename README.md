#Bash Yahtzee

Just a little bash script that I'm doing randomly to keep myself familiarized
with git and bash.

###Current usage:
```
playyahtzee [number of dice] [number of rolls]
```

###Example:
```
$ ./playyahtzee 5 2000
On roll 263, I got a YAHTZEE!
On roll 1068, I got a YAHTZEE!
On roll 1419, I got a YAHTZEE!
On roll 1521, I got a YAHTZEE!
On roll 1594, I got a YAHTZEE!
On roll 1919, I got a YAHTZEE!
```

I'm adding some more info and functionality to it as I go along.
