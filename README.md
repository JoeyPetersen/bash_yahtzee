#Bash Yahtzee

Just a little bash script that I'm doing randomly to keep myself familiarized
with git and bash.

###Current usage:
```
playyahtzee [number of dice] [number of games]
```

###Example:
```
$ ./playyahtzee 5 500
==============================
| Games played: 500
| Total turns:  6500
| Total rolls:  19500
==============================


Tally of all dice rolled:
1: 16198    2: 16296    3: 16193    4: 16063    5: 16420    6: 16330    

Number of Yahtzee's that were rolled: 12
Game: 14    Turn: 7     Roll: 2
Game: 28    Turn: 7     Roll: 3
Game: 80    Turn: 4     Roll: 1
Game: 239       Turn: 6     Roll: 3
Game: 287       Turn: 13    Roll: 3
Game: 306       Turn: 6     Roll: 1
Game: 309       Turn: 9     Roll: 2
Game: 316       Turn: 11    Roll: 3
Game: 387       Turn: 1     Roll: 3
Game: 405       Turn: 13    Roll: 2
Game: 471       Turn: 7     Roll: 2
Game: 478       Turn: 5     Roll: 2
```

I'm adding some more info and functionality to it as I go along.
